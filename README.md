# Knapsack-Problem
Java program which can resolve the knapsack problem in 3 ways: the 0/1, the BnB and the dynamic method.

The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, 
each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the 
total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. 
It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must 
fill it with the most valuable items.

The problem often arises in resource allocation where there are financial constraints and is studied 
in fields such as combinatorics, computer science, complexity theory, cryptography, applied mathematics and 
daily fantasy sports.

I developped this program in Java using Eclipse.
